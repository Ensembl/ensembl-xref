=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Xref::Parser::ZFIN - Base parser class for ZFIN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a base class providing common data and methods for specialisations
tailored to parsing UniProt, RefSeq and aliases ZFIN files.

It's organised this way since the eHive pipeline is assumed to process
one file at a time.
